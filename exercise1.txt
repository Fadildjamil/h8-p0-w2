1. Newton Second Law                         
====================                       
                                                 
Algorithm :                                                           
                                            
 1. Create m with value number 600          
 2. Create a with value number 2            
 3. Calculate m times a                     
 4. Result from calculate set as F (Newton) 

Pseudocode :

STORE "m" with 600
STORE "a" with 2

CALCULATE "m" times "a"
SET "F" with calculation result

DISPLAY "F"


2. Leap Year
=============

Algorithm :

1. Input Year
2. IF the modulo after Year divide with 4 not equals with 0 then the display show "Not Leap year"
3. IF the modulo after Year divide with 100 equals 0 and modulo after Year divide 400 not equals with 0, the display "Not Leap year"
4. IF the all conditions not requirements then Display "Leap Year"


Pseudocode :

IF "Year" mod 4 not equals 0 
  Display "Year" + "Not leap year"

IF "Year" mod 100 equals 0 And "Year" mod 400 not equals to 0
  Display "Year" + "Not leap year"

IF all condition not 
  Display "Year" + "Leap Year"
  

3. Laundry Day
================

Algorithm :

1. Create P as variable Clothes
2. Add one by one clothes in Washer until 20
3. Start Washer 
4. If not, the washer cant Start

Pseudocode :

STORE "P" with 0

WHILE "P" < 20
  ADD "P" by 1
END WHILE 

DISPLAY "Start Machine"

4. Checking Nails
==================

Algorithm :

1. The teacher walking and explore classes
2. In that school, just have two classes 
3. Total students in each class is 20 students
4. If the teacher found Long nails in Student, the Student get punished
5. If not, The student get compliment


Pseudocode :

SET "S" as Students
SET "T" as Teacher
SET "LN" as Long nails

IF "T" found "LN" in "S"
    DISPLAY "Get Punished"
ELSE
    DISPLAY "Get Compliment"

DO while until get "S" equals to 40
